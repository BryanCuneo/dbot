# dbot
A plugin-based Discord bot framework

This framework was made with a much older version of Discord.py. Many features have been added since then, including a built-in bot command framework. This framework still works, but I wouldn't recommend using it. I may rewrite this sometime soon(TM) to utilize the new features.

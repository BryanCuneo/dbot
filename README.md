# DBot - A plugin-based Discord bot framework

DBot is a no-nonsense way to spin up a Discord bot with minimal minimal effort. Simply [create a bot account](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html), copy your API key into [config.toml](/config.toml), and run `python main.py`.

---
DBot began as a personal project in 2018. Though it served it's purpose at the time, it quickly fell out of date. The underlying library, [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and Python itself have made significant changes over the last 4 years, and so I have the process of modernizing this framework. It's very much a work-in-progress, but it's still quite usable.

## Getting Started
Coming soon.

## Plugins
Plugins are how you add functionality to your bot. See [PLUGINS.md](PLUGINS.md) for more info.
